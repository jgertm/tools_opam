Platform definitions for controlling the  OPAM-based toolchains.

Naming scheme follows the structure of the tool names:
@opam//tc/<emit mode>:<optimization>

@opam//tc/n      = ocamlopt
@opam//tc/n:opt  = ocamlopt.opt  (optimized native code emitter)
@opam//tc/bc     = ocaml
@opam//tc/bc:opt = ocamlc.opt    (optimized bytecode emitter)

tc/emitter is for constraint values
